Itext
=====

Ever see something on the web but cannot access them on the phone because you don't have a smartphone? 

Maybe there's no wifi near you. 

No problem. 

Itext is a chrome extension app that allows you to send any information on the web page to your phone via texting so you can access them on your phone. 

Stage of development: Still needs to implement the texting part.
